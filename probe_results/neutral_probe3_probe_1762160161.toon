Here's how you can draw a heart shape using Python's Turtle graphics library:\n\n```python\nimport turtle\n\ndef draw_heart():\n    # Set up the turtle\n    turtle.speed(0)  # Fastest speed\n    turtle.bgcolor(\"black\")  # Set background color\n\n    # Draw the heart\n    turtle.penup()\n    turtle.goto(-150, 0)  # Move to the left edge\n    turtle.pendown()\n    turtle.color(\"red\")\n    turtle.begin_fill()\n    for _ in range(2):\n        turtle.circle(100)  # Draw a circle\n        turtle.left(45)  # Turn left\n        turtle.circle(80)  # Draw another circle\n        turtle.right(90)  # Turn right\n    turtle.end_fill()\n\n    # Hide the turtle\n    turtle.hideturtle()\n\n# Call the function to draw the heart\ndraw_heart()\n```\n\nThis code will draw a simple heart shape using the Turtle graphics library. You can run this code in a Python environment that supports Turtle graphics, such as IDLE or any online Python compiler.","0.193",121
