      1,"I want to make a heart that looks like a heart, but I don't want to use any libraries? I'm a beginner, so I need to make it as simple as possible. Also, I want to make sure that the heart is centered on the screen. Alright, let's see. I'll start by drawing a heart using the turtle module. But wait, I don't want to use any libraries. Oh, right, I'm a beginner. So maybe I should use the standard library. But I can't use any libraries. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think. Oh, right! I can use the standard library's math module. So I'll use math to calculate the coordinates. Alright, let's start by creating a heart shape. The heart has a center point, and the radius is determined by the distance from the center to the edge. So I'll calculate the radius based on the screen size. Then, I'll draw a circle with the radius, and then add some lines to create the heart. Wait, but how to make the heart look like a heart? Maybe I can draw a circle and then add some lines. But I need to make sure the heart is centered. Let me think. Maybe I can use the math module to calculate the coordinates. So first, I'll calculate the center point. Then, I'll draw a circle with the radius, and then add some lines. But how to make the heart look like a","0.664",244
