I'm a beginner, so I need to make a heart that looks like a heart, but I don't want to use any libraries. So I'll use the standard library's math module. Let me start by calculating the center point. Then, I'll draw a circle with the radius. Then, I'll add some lines. But how to make the heart look like a heart? Maybe I can use the math module to calculate the coordinates. Let me try to code this. So, the code would be something like:

import math

center_x = 1</pre>
